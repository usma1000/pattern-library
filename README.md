# CWRU Pattern Library
A gallery of all the patterns and their code.

## Setup
Clone the project with git.

`cd` into the root directory with Gulpfile.js

Run `npm install` to get all the dependencies.

Run `gulp` to start browser-sync as well as SASS and Nunjucks in watch mode.

## Editing
This project uses Nunjucks as the template engine and SASS.

Do not edit any HTML or CSS files as they are auto generated by Nunjucks and Sass.

### Editing Styles
To edit styles, find the SASS file that is associated with the section you are editing.

variables.sass holds all of the SASS variables that are used throughout the project.

This project also uses [Bourbon](bourbon.io) for mixins and [Neat](neat.bourbon.io) for the grid system. This helps keep the markup clean and easy to read.

### Editing a Pattern Section
To edit the text for a particular pattern, such as the accordion, open the accordion.nunjucks file in the templates/partials folder.

The `.display-box` div points to the actual code for that pattern. It's the raw html code that is used for the websites. This code lives in the templates/partials/mod folder. All of the code in that folder is taken straight from GitHub and not edited in any way.

The code for the Show Markup button lives in the templates/partials/code folder. This is essentially a copy of the same code from the mod folder, but with a few important differences. The comments must be removed. The outer most tags must not be tabbed over. And all `<` should be replaced with `&lt;`.
